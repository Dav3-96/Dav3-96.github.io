Hi! I'm Dave, a Gameplay Systems programmer, and wearer of many hats at South Westerly Games Ltd.

Wearer of many hats is a joke in and of itself, I personally wear many different hats, and during dev, I do a lot of different work dotted around unreal engine.

Some of the things that I have done, that I am proud of.

- Full controller support and UI integration.  
- Bespoke, lightweight and fully modular ability system.  
- Bespoke, lightweight and fully modular status effect system.  
- An infinitely branching dialogue system that can rival Baldur's Gate 1/2, Neverwinter Nights, Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous, and Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2.  
- Engine optimisation and code optimisation to hit certain requirements for systems.
